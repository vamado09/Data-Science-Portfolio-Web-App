# Data-Science-Portfolio-Web-App
My Data Science Streamlit web application.


Welcome to my Data Science Streamlit web application repository. Here, you'll gain insights into both my persona and the projects I developed during my Data Science master's program at Indiana University. This repository serves a dual purpose: it offers a platform for deploying the app via Streamlit Cloud and provides a Google Colab notebook detailing the project's creation process.
