        "        After graduating from Florida State University with a Bachelorâ€™s in Risk Management & Insurance, I pursued my aspiration to excel as a professional athlete, focusing on the sport of boxing. Over the course of more than 10 years, I dedicated myself to reaching the pinnacle of the Panamanian National Olympic Team and aimed to secure the esteemed world champion title. Despite my relentless efforts, this dream eventually concluded, leading to a new chapter in my life.\n",

        "        Transitioning from the boxing ring to the real world came with personal challenges, and it was time to try new things. I embarked on a new career at Banco Aliado, S.A, a Panamanian private bank. As a Financial Risk Analyst, I delved into financial management and risk assessment, notably during the Covid-19 pandemic. This hard work led to a promotion, allowing me to become a Data Analyst in the bank's Risk Department - Portfolio Management area. In this new role, my fascination with data, statistics, and machine learning found its foundation and began to flourish.\n",

        "        Driven by the desire for growth and a passion for continuous learning, I made the significant decision to leave behind Panama again to embrace a new adventure in the United States. I enrolled in Indiana University for a Master's in Data Science. This academic pursuit not only enriched my personal life but also empowered me professionally. My focus gravitated toward the analytical facets of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. These areas resonated with my curiosity and problem-solving inclination, creating a path that feels both challenging and rewarding.\n",

        "        After graduating from Florida State University with a Bachelorâ€™s in Risk Management & Insurance, I pursued my aspiration to excel as a professional athlete, focusing on the sport of boxing. Over the course of more than 10 years, I dedicated myself to reaching the pinnacle of the Panamanian National Olympic Team and aimed to secure the esteemed world champion title. Despite my relentless efforts, this dream eventually concluded, leading to a new chapter in my life.\n",

        "        Transitioning from the boxing ring to the real world came with personal challenges, and it was time to try new things. I embarked on a new career at Banco Aliado, S.A, a Panamanian private bank. As a Financial Risk Analyst, I delved into financial management and risk assessment, notably during the Covid-19 pandemic. This hard work led to a promotion, allowing me to become a Data Analyst in the bank's Risk Department - Portfolio Management area. In this new role, my fascination with data, statistics, and machine learning found its foundation and began to flourish.\n",

        "        Driven by the desire for growth and a passion for continuous learning, I made the significant decision to leave behind Panama again to embrace a new adventure in the United States. I enrolled in Indiana University for a Master's in Data Science. This academic pursuit not only enriched my personal life but also empowered me professionally. My focus gravitated toward the analytical facets of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. These areas resonated with my curiosity and problem-solving inclination, creating a path that feels both challenging and rewarding.\n",
